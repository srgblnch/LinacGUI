Very basic information to develop on this gui:

From the source directory (src), and to have the widgets specifically developed, the call to the designer can be:
$ taurusdesigner --taurus-path=./widgets widgets/ui/*.ui &

With this all the widgets made for this interface opened and having them in the widget box. There are three groups:
- Taurus Linac Main: with the three tabbed widgets
- Taurus Linac Widgets: with the collection of widgets used in the previous group
- Taurus Linac Snapshot: the widgets used in the ctlisetup application for the save/retreve.

To generate py files:
$ taurusuic4 widgets/ui/+.ui -o widgets/ui_+.py
Where + means the name of the widget.
